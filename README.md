# BSQ
The goal of this project is to find the biggets square of "." inside a map compose of : 
1st line -> numbers of rows;
Others lines -> "." and "o" with "\n" at the end of the lines. 
The BSQ must has to display the biggest square inside the map with "x" as fast as possible.

To execute the BSQ:
1st step -> create a valid map (I give you an example in the Repository) ;
2nd step -> make ; make clean ;
3rd step -> ./bsq map.txt

This project could be faster and can be done with an other kind of algorithm.
Make your own BSQ. Good luck.
